This repository hosts the Flame Haze Society Expense Reimbursement System. The codebase
is split into two packages:

- **flamehazesociety-server** – Node.js/TypeScript backend.
- **flamehazesociety-ui** – React user interface.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 12 or newer
- npm (bundled with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### Server

```bash
cd flamehazesociety-server
npm install
npm start
```

### UI

```bash
cd flamehazesociety-ui
npm install
npm start
```

Ensure the server is running before interacting with the UI (typically available on
http://localhost:3000/).
